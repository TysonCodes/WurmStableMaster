# Stable Master for Wurm Unlimited

## Requirements
* Requires [Ago1024's server modloader](https://github.com/ago1024/WurmServerModLauncher/releases/latest) on the server.

## Installation
* Download StableMaster.zip
* Extract StableMaster.zip into wurm unlimited server folder 
(for example, C:/Program Files/SteamLibrary/SteamApps/common/Wurm Unlimited Dedicated Server). 
The StableMaster.jar file should end up in mods/StableMaster/StableMaster.jar.
* Optionally modify the properties.
* Start the server and connect.

## Background
Created in response to razoreqx's request on the Wurm Online forums. Also seemed like something I'd like to have to go 
exploring on a boat and still have a horse when I got there.

## Effects
* Adds a new NPC to the game, Stable Master.
* You can right-click the Stable Master while riding a horse to have the horse exchanged for an Horse Redepmtion Token.
  * Note there is a fee associated with exchanging the horse into an Horse Redepmtion Token.
  * Note the horse weights what the equivalent corpse would weight and takes up the same amount of space (volume.)
* You can right-click on the Horse Redepmtion Token to turn it back into a horse at your current location.
* The Horse Redepmtion Token can be loaded onto boats of sufficient size.
